## 1) What is DBMS?
A DBMS is software that manages databases, providing an interface to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently and securely.

## 2) What is a Database?
A Database is an organized, consistent, and logical collection of data that can easily be updated, accessed, and managed. Database mostly contains sets of tables or objects which consist of records and fields.

## 3) Explain the difference between a database and a DBMS?
A database is a collection of related data, while a DBMS is software used to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently from the database.

## 4) Advantages of DBMS over File Systems?
- ### Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

Redundancy means repeating the data in a system. In a normal file system, there is a high chance that there can be various files of the same data used by different users for specific purposes. If any user changes the data in its files, then the changes are not reflected in all files. This creates inconsistency in the data, and it may lead to the failure of the system. But in the DBMS, there is only one repository of data, and multiple users can use it. If any user changes the data, then it is reflected to each user as they are using the same repository.
- ### Data Sharing:

In the normal file system, data sharing is too difficult because file sharing is a complex task. In DBMS, all the data is centralized, so data sharing is a very easy task.
- ### Data Concurrency:

When more than one user accesses the database simultaneously, then it is called concurrency. In a file system, when multiple users are using the files at the same time, then there may be a chance of anomalies in the data due to changes, and it does not provide any method to detect anomalies. But in DBMS, we have a locking system to detect the anomalies so we can protect the data.
- ### Data Searching:

To search the data in a file system, we have to write a specific program and run it. In DBMS, we have query languages by which we can write small queries to get the data we want from the database. We can use various query languages, like MySQL, Oracle, etc., for a database to search and retrieve the data.
- ### Data Integrity:

When we insert new data into the database, we require some specific constraints on the data like integer or not null, etc. The file system does not provide any system to check the constraints, whereas DBMS has the functionality to check the constraints on the data, and it allows user defined data types.

## 5) What is the different languages present in DBMS?
-  DDL(Data Definition Language): It contains commands which are required to define the database. \ E.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, etc.
-  DML(Data Manipulation Language): It contains commands which are required to manipulate the data present in the database.
  E.g., SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc.
- DCL(Data Control Language): It contains commands which are required to deal with the user permissions and controls of the database system.
E.g., GRANT and REVOKE.
- TCL(Transaction Control Language): It contains commands which are required to deal with the transaction of the database.
E.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

## 6) Difference between the DELETE and TRUNCATE command in a DBMS?
-  DELETE Command:
  1) It removes rows from a table one by one with transaction logging
  2) It can be rolled back if required.

-  TRUNCATE Command:
  1) It removes all rows at once without transaction logging.
  2) It can't be rolled back.

## 7) ACID properties in DBMS?

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability in a DBMS these are those properties that ensure a safe and secure way of sharing data among multiple users.
-  Atomicity: This property reflects the concept of either executing the whole query or executing nothing at all, which implies that if an update occurs in a database then that update should either be reflected in the whole database or should not be reflected at all.
-  Consistency: This property ensures that the data remains consistent before and after a transaction in a database.
-  Isolation: This property ensures that each transaction is occurring independently of the others. This implies that the state of an ongoing transaction doesnâ€™t affect the state of another ongoing transaction.
-  Durability: This property ensures that the data is not lost in cases of a system failure or restart and is present in the same state as it was before the system failure or restart.

## 8) What is meant by Normalization and Denormalization?

-  Normalization is a process of reducing redundancy by organizing the data into multiple tables. Normalization leads to better usage of disk spaces and makes it easier to maintain the integrity of the database.
-  Denormalization is the reverse process of normalization as it combines the tables which have been normalized into a single table so that data retrieval becomes faster. JOIN operation allows us to create a denormalized form of the data by reversing the normalization.

## 9) Different types of Normalization forms in a DBMS?
- 1NF: It is known as the first normal form and is the simplest type of normalization that you can implement in a database. A table to be in its first normal form should satisfy the following conditions:
  1) Every column must have a single value and should be atomic.
  2) Duplicate columns from the same table should be removed.
  3) Separate tables should be created for each group of related data and each row should be identified with a unique column.
- 2NF: It is known as the second normal form. A table to be in its second normal form should satisfy the following conditions:
  1) The table should be in its 1NF i.e. satisfy all the conditions of 1NF.
  2) Every non-prime attribute of the table should be fully functionally dependent on the primary key i.e. every non-key attribute should be dependent on the primary key in such a way that if any key element is deleted then even the non_key element will be saved in the database.
- 3NF: It is known as the third normal form. A table to be in its third normal form should satisfy the following conditions:
  1) The table should be in its 2NF i.e. satisfy all the conditions of 2NF.
  2) There is no transitive functional dependency of one attribute on any attribute in the same table.
- BCNF: BCNF stands for Boyce-Codd Normal Form and is an advanced form of 3NF. It is also referred to as 3.5NF for the same reason. A table to be in its BCNF normal form should satisfy the following conditions:
  1) The table should be in its 3NF i.e. satisfy all the conditions of 3NF.
  2) For every functional dependency of any attribute A on B (A->B), A should be the super key of the table. It simply implies that A canâ€™t be a non-prime attribute if B is a prime attribute.

## 10) What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER-Diagram)?
An ER-Diagram is a visual representation of the relationships among entities in a database, showing how different tables are connected.

## 11)Different types of keys in a database?
-  Primary key: The Primary key is an attribute in a table that can uniquely identify each record in a table. It is compulsory for every table.
-  Unique Key: The unique key is very similar to the primary key except that primary keys donâ€™t allow NULL values in the column but unique keys allow them.
-  Foreign key: The Foreign key is a primary key from one table, which has a relationship with another table. It acts as a cross-reference between tables.

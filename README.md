## 1) What is DBMS?
A DBMS is software that manages databases, providing an interface to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently and securely.

## 2) What is a Database?
A Database is an organized, consistent, and logical collection of data that can easily be updated, accessed, and managed. Database mostly contains sets of tables or objects which consist of records and fields.

## 3) Explain the difference between a database and a DBMS?
A database is a collection of related data, while a DBMS is software used to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently from the database.

## 4) Advantages of DBMS over File Systems?
- ### Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

Redundancy means repeating the data in a system. In a normal file system, there is a high chance that there can be various files of the same data used by different users for specific purposes. If any user changes the data in its files, then the changes are not reflected in all files. This creates inconsistency in the data, and it may lead to the failure of the system. But in the DBMS, there is only one repository of data, and multiple users can use it. If any user changes the data, then it is reflected to each user as they are using the same repository.
- ### Data Sharing:

In the normal file system, data sharing is too difficult because file sharing is a complex task. In DBMS, all the data is centralized, so data sharing is a very easy task.
- ### Data Concurrency:

When more than one user accesses the database simultaneously, then it is called concurrency. In a file system, when multiple users are using the files at the same time, then there may be a chance of anomalies in the data due to changes, and it does not provide any method to detect anomalies. But in DBMS, we have a locking system to detect the anomalies so we can protect the data.
- ### Data Searching:

To search the data in a file system, we have to write a specific program and run it. In DBMS, we have query languages by which we can write small queries to get the data we want from the database. We can use various query languages, like MySQL, Oracle, etc., for a database to search and retrieve the data.
- ### Data Integrity:

When we insert new data into the database, we require some specific constraints on the data like integer or not null, etc. The file system does not provide any system to check the constraints, whereas DBMS has the functionality to check the constraints on the data, and it allows user defined data types.
